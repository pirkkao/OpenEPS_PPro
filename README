# OpenEPS_PPro 
#
#
# This is a program that executes post-processing tasks
# for an ensemble of model forecasts. The program is
# designed to be run on multiple cores using GNU 
# parallel. 
#
# master.bash is the main program that initiates the
# parallel job executions. Various post-processing tasks
# can be called from this script. The default tasks called
# will do 1) a bilinear interpolation to a 1*/1* regular 
# lat-lon grid, 2) calculate ensemble mean and standard 
# deviation, and 3) collects forecast ranges of same
# length into a NetCDF-file.
#
#
# In order to setup a new post-processing flow, simply
# create a unique configuration file by copying the 
# "config"-file.

# PARALLEL PERFORMANCE
# 

# 4 cores
 config pbash: 4 and pstep: 4 in 812

# 8 cores
 config pbash: 8 and pstep: 8 in 427
 config pbash: 6 and pstep: 6 in 401
 config pbash: 4 and pstep: 4 in 416

# 16 cores
 config pbash:  8 and pstep:  8 in 265
 config pbash: 12 and pstep: 12 in 298
 config pbash: 16 and pstep: 16 in 357
 config pbash: 16 and pstep: 16 in 320
 config pbash: 16 and pstep:  8 in 267

Because of the way the timesteps are split (a bit 
awkwardly) it is really important to use a "pstep"
-value that does the division in an effective way. 
The values for exp with 

fclen=240 
fcstep=6 

should be:
parallel_step=1
parallel_step=2
parallel_step=4
parallel_step=8
parallel_step=20
parallel_step=40
